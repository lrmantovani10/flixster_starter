### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The CSS features covered on the first lab (grid, flexbox), as well as the HTML (through as divs and spans) prepared me for this assignment. I also think that the second lab's JavaScript DOM manipulation and the third one's async functionalities helped me prepare for Flixster. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have added filters so that the user could determine what movies should
show up on the top of the page (for example, filters by rating or release date)

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I really liked everything I did, but I saw a girl in my group who added a feature which allowed the user to 
flip the poster when clicking on it, so that might be a cool idea for next time!
